Brain Tumor Classification using CNN
This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying brain tumors based on MRI scans. The trained model is then deployed as a web application using Flask, allowing users to upload MRI scans and obtain the predicted tumor classification.
Project Overview
The project consists of the following main components:

Data Preprocessing: The MRI scan images are preprocessed and prepared for training the CNN model.
Model Training: Various CNN architectures, such as VGG16 and Inception, are explored for training the brain tumor classification model.
Model Deployment: The trained CNN model is deployed as a web application using Flask, enabling users to upload MRI scans and receive the predicted tumor classification.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
Copy codegit clone https://github.com/your-username/Brain-Classification-CNN.git

Install the required dependencies:
Copy codepip install -r requirements.txt

Generate the pre-trained model files (.h5 files) by running the respective CNN architecture scripts in the Program CNN folder.
Deploy the Flask application by running the app.py file:
Copy codepython app.py
The Flask application will start running, and you can access it through the provided URL (e.g., http://localhost:5000).
Upload an MRI scan image through the web interface, and the deployed model will predict the tumor classification.
